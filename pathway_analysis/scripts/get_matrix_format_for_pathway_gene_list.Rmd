This script takes in results a two-column pathway-gene list and converts it to matrix format (to plot gene vs. pathway)

```{r}
library(tidyr) # gather

# read in data
genes_per_pathway.df <- read.table("/Volumes/shung/projects/gzl_exomes/pathway_analysis/go_enrichment/panther_pathway-gene_mutated_targets.txt", sep = "\t", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)

genes.vs.pathway <- table(genes_per_pathway.df$gene, genes_per_pathway.df$full_pathway)

# write result to output
write.table(genes.vs.pathway, "/Volumes/shung/projects/gzl_exomes/pathway_analysis/go_enrichment/matrix-panther_pathway-VS-gene_mutated_targets.txt", sep = "\t", quote = FALSE)
```
